#### Experience<br>
Current and previous research has included analytical coding via **R** as the basis for:  
- **Multi-level regression modeling**  
- **Propensity score matching** (``matchit`` and bespoke [a la ``psmatch2`` in STATA])  
- **Synthetic control analysis**  (``synth`` package)  
- **Survival analysis** (``survival`` and ``survminer``)
- **Psychometric analyses** (``CTT``, ``ltm`` and ``lavaan``)  
- **Power and meta-analysis** (``pwr``, ``epiR``, ``meta`` and ``metafor`` packages)  
- **basic comparative statistics** (t-tests, chi-square, AUC, etc.)  

I'm also pretty fluent in ``tidyverse``, ``ggplot2``, etc., and can write functions as required
